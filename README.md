# Wheel of Time Old Tongue translator 
 A JS app which translates normal English to Wheel of Time Old Tongue Text. The Old Tongue is a now-dead language in the Wheel of Time universe (an Amazon special webseries), but now spoken only by scholars and certain nobles. Our Wheel of Time translator takes plain English and converts it to Wheel of time old tongue. (motivation : I am a big fan of the series and Rosamund Pike)

## v2.0
-- chnaged code base from vanilla JS to react. but instead of `create-react-app`, used _svelte's_ react version as it 4 times lesser of size from default react app. also with this setup, installation of _vite_ is required.

-- added error handling which is one of the most important thing when dealing with APIs.

-- changed design to web3 inspired modern designs. although this site is not fully responsive as of now.
